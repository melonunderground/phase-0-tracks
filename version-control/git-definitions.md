**Instructions: **

* What is version control?  version control allows you to commit changes you make to a repository and review them before adding to the master repository. Why is it useful? version control allows multiple parties to work on the same project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one? a branch is a copy of the master up to a certain time and is useful to review changes before updating the master.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? a commit is a change made to a file and the more detailed the commit message the easier it is to review in the future.
* What is a merge conflict? merge conflict is when changes were made to the control branch and the new branch. only one branch should change from the control.
